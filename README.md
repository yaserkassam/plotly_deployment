## Project Overview

In this project I am tasked to create different charts for us to visualize each volunteers bacterial data in different types of charts. Also, creating interactive charts that changed based on the ID that is picked.

- Horizontal Bar Chart- Identifying the top 10 bacterial species found in the navel of each ID.
- Bubble Chart-         That shows the IDs bacterial cultures per sample in the naval.
- Gauge Chart-          Showing the naval washing frequency per week.
